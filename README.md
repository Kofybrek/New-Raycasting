# New-Raycasting

I turned my raycasting project into a little horror game. I used C++ and SFML.

Here's the video explaining how I did it: https://youtu.be/OpIS1zoz6fU

# To build the game:
1. Clone the repo
2. Change your working directory to the `Source` by `cd New-Raycasting/Source`
3. Compile with g++ by running the following command
```sh
g++ *.cpp -std=c++17 -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o steven
```
4. Run the executable
